# Bundle Package Explorer

BrainStation Industry Project with Telus

# The Overview
Created in a 24 hour hackathon style spring, this app is a recreation of Telus' bundle options, revamped for a more user friendly and accessible experience, adding more eye catching elements, along with easier to read comparisons. Also added is a quick access button for relevant customer support links and a one-click button to the customer support line, eliminating frustration, and digging through the website for support information.

# The Problem
- Consumers are experiencing option paralysis
- The bundle choices are unclear, and not distinctive enough
- Consumers may gloss over important information, due to details being presented in plain text


# The Solution
- Make an eye catching component to help consumers identify what is important to them
- Make it easy to navigate for all populations on all platforms
- Make it easy to compare bundle deals, increasing consumer 
confidence when purchasing

# The Process
- Research plan/bundle options from other sources
- Create initial mockups
- Iterate over all aspects to find the most accessible layout

# The Conclusion
